# S²PIRE - Scalable & Smart Platform for Innovation, Research & Engineering

## Introduction - What is this all about?
I'm dissatisfied with the current state of programming. I think we can do better. Have better tools, better languages, etc.

This organization is where I want to work on those things. Some things might only be prototypes or experiments, but the end goal
is to have a system which provides a unified programming environment. Starting from the OS, including a programming language,
tools to analyze the code, up to the (projectional) editor you use to work with everything.

Right now, I'm currently in the research and experimentation phase. I'm looking at different tools and techniques to make this
vision come true. My plan is to use zig for most of the code, but that's not set in stone either.

## Contributions

Right now, I wont be taking any contributions, as I don't know where things are headed. If you think you can help regardless or
have some nice resources for me (whitepapers, tools, libraries, blog posts, etc.), you can find me on matrix via @hardliner66:matrix.org
